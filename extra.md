2. databases:


I have a cloud database service provided by AWS to achieve remote connection to my MySQL database. I created 7 entities at entity folder to construct my database and there are imformation about mysql including database name, password, host and more at src/data-source file. I had to modify almost all previous functions because the data structure we used in the previous iteration was not suitable for constructing the database directly. I abandoned some unnecessary functions that did not affect the normal running of the new routes to reduce my workload.
